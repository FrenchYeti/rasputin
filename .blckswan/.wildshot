Hi.
This might be a long shot, yet I have to try.


I'm not by any means a developer of any sorts.  
(More or less still stuck in a basic goto-loop from 1999.)
But I do some debugging, and I am a "hacker by nature". 

I could need some support and advice, and something tells me this could be the right spot.


Sqlite, software backups, dbus, APIs
If any one think they know what Im talking about, I would be thrilled if you pinged me!
